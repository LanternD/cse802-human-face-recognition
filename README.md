# CSE 802 Pattern Recognition Final Project: Unconstrained Face Recognition Challenge

This repo are the source code and documents for the CSE802 Pattern Recognition final project. 

# Basics

- Use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the face features. Validate the extracted features with BLUFR protocol. Compare the results with:
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  - LDA (Linear Discreminant Analysis)
  - LBP (Local Binary Patterns)
  - LE (Learning-baed Descriptors)
- Training database: CASIA WEBFace Database, 494,414 pictures of 10,575 subjects. 
- Test database: LFW (Labeled Face in the Wild) database, 13,233 pictures of 5,749 subjects.

# Results
